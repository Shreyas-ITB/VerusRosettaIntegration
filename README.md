# VerusRosettaIntegration

The APIs that are used to link Verus blockchain with Open-Source Coinbase Rosetta Blockchain integration tools.

## Requirements

- Python needs to be installed if you are trying to run the API, version 3.9.8 (tested) 3.10, 3.11 works fine.
- A Linux server of atleast 8GB RAM and a decent processor to handle the requests.

## Running the APIs

Clone the github repository \
```git clone https://github.com/Shreyas-ITB/VerusRosettaIntegration``` \

Rename the ``example.env`` into ``.env`` and then edit the following information present in it.

```
RPCURL=VERUS RPC URL # Replace this with actual verusd rpc url.
DATAPIPORT=5500 # This is the default port on which the Data API runs on, edit it as per your needs.
CONSTAPIPORT=5600 # This is the default port on which the Construction API runs on, edit it as per your needs.
RUN_PRODUCTION=False # Change this to True if you are running the APIs in production mode.
```
